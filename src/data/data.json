The solution generated interesting ideas that fit popular topics in their social media + relevant topics and news. The project was retaken and redone in 7 days; creating a faster and computational cheaper solution to raise founding in Mexico. Mentioned by Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP), Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores, many TV news programs, newspapers and social media in Mexico.",

Moreover, modern technologies are difficult to master for the general audience in order to express meaningful ideas. This project gave meaning to AI Art, NFTs, and Electro Encephalograms (EEG); and direction to use them as a tool and not the end result. My Brain Machine Interface (BMI) Art Studio, transforms a VR environment and your paintings with your emotions. That way, people can create art by using their fellings, to later store them in the blockchain. With the use of AI, people can paint with image2image models, transform their final outcome with an emotion, and change their Virtual Reality Art studio with their mood. The emotion detection is done with a Time Series Classification that can identify 3 cognitive states (Positive, Neutral and Negative).",
