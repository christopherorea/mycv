    "description":"At LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group), within the Pattern Library Engineering team, I spearheaded the integration of cloud architecture and led the development of AI solutions leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). My key achievement was the delivery of a proof-of-concept Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Neo4j as the knowledge graph database and an LLM for natural language understanding and generation. This involved implementing vector indexing for efficient retrieval of relevant information. The successful POC led to a research study focused on quantifying the time and cost benefits of utilizing LLMs for search and data analysis. Furthermore, I developed a search and recommendation engine that incorporated data reasoning capabilities, enabling more intelligent and context-aware results. This project was completed within a tight one-month timeframe.",
