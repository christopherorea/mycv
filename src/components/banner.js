                    I'm a natural language processing and generation expert with a
                    passion for research and development. I have a bachelor's degree
                    in data from Universidad IEU (Big Data), where I learned how to
                    apply cutting-edge techniques to solve real-world problems. I'm
                    also a full stack developer with experience in Python and
                    ReactJs, and I love creating innovative web applications that
                    use artificial intelligence.

                    In addition to my professional skills, I'm also an entrepreneur
                    and an artificial intelligence consultant. I help businesses and
                    individuals leverage the power of AI to achieve their goals and
                    improve their performance. I also share my knowledge and
                    insights on Instagram and YouTube as @thcookieh, where I talk
                    mostly about Artificial Intelligence and travel.
